# Memory-Game
Unit 1 Project for GA


In this game, the player will be presented with an array of cards.
Each card will be faced down and the order in which they are displayed will be randomized.

The player's objective is to turn over each card in the array and find a matching card.
If the player is successful, cards will remained overturned.
If the player's selections do not result in a match, then both cards are turned back over,
and the player must select more cards. 

The outcome of the game will be decided by two methods:
The player successfully finds all matching cards before the timer runs out.
Or the timer ends and the player loses.
