# Gotta Match 'Em All! 
## Memory Game
### Unit 1 Project for GA
-------------------------------
### Objectives
In this game, the player will be presented with an array of cards.
Each card will be faced down and the order in which they are displayed will be randomized.

The player's objective is to turn over each card in the array and find a matching card.
If the player is successful, cards will remained overturned.
If the player's selections do not result in a match, then both cards are turned back over,
and the player must select more cards. 

The outcome of the game will be decided by two methods:
The player successfully finds all matching cards before the timer runs out.
Or the timer ends and the player loses.

### About This Game
I had a lot of fun (and tons of stress) designing and building this game. What was assigned as a project turned out to be a neat little adventure, in which I learned a lot and also learned just how much I don't know about JavaScript. After all the times I wanted to pull my hair out, I was pleasantly surprised in the end result and then the satisfaction came. I chose this game format ultimately because it seemed like one of the easiest to manage, yet I was still shocked at just how much game logic goes into a simple program like this one.

### Special Thanks
This game would not have been made without the wonderful instructors and assistants at General Assembly: Michael Petty, James Sinkler, Uyen Lam, and Jacob Kleiman.
A huge shoutout goes to fellow GA students Lucy Franco and Jane Cho whose ideas and collaboration were paramount to this game's formation. Special thanks to all of my other fellow GA students for their commitment to our group's success and family environment.
